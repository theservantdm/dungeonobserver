			<h2>Just what is this "Fragility System"?</h2>
				<p>In short, it's an alternate to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D20_System">d20 System</a> designed around the other types of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice#Polyhedral_dice">polyhedral dice</a>.</p>
				<p>The goal of the system was to use the natural properties of the dice to refect character progression and to have a flexible and intuative system for resolving events. Also, to incorporate character fatigue and damage as a factor into in-game outcomes, and to have a better spectrum of character abilities to draw on for event resolution.</p>
			<h2>Alright, I'm interested, how does it work?</h2>
				<p>The player character's ability scores are measured by the type of polyhedral dice (1d4 to 2d12). Dice are rolled against a success criteria of getting above a 3. Thus a d4 has a 25% chance of succes, a d12 has a 75% of success, 2d6 have a 50% chance of 1 success and an additional 25% chance of a double success, etc.</p>
				<p>In addition to this, creatures can acquire fatigue and wound dice which count as a negative success if they roll above a 3. Fatigue dice are d6's (50% chance) and wound dice are d12's (75% chance) and can accumulate depending on character actions.</p>
				<p>Ability checks are used to resolve uncertian outcomes, using a contested roll whenever possible, and an set number of successes when not.</p>
				<p>An example might be throwing a punch in a barfight. The DM would call for you to roll a strength + dexterity + proficiency check contested by your opponent's dexterity + strength + armour</p>
				<p>Ability scores are defined on two specturms: they measure your physical, psyche, and persona against force, finesse, and fortitude (yes, I deserve an A+ for the alliteration).</p>

				<p>This is an idea that's been bouncing around my head since late 2017, and I think Dungeon Observer will be a great place to hammer out the details once I get it running the way I want.</p>
